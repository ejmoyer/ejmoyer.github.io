        <h1>C:\about\overview</h1>
        <p>I was born in Hershey, Pennsylvania on the 28th of January, 2000. I grew up in the small
            and rather unknown town of Quarryville, near the southern end of Pennsylviana, in Lancaster county.
            I first touched a computer at around the age of 6 or 7, and have been interested in them ever since then. My interests have been varied over my life, and will continue
            to change in the many years forward. My biggest interests today are programming,
            fighting games and Magic the Gathering.</p>
        <h2>C:\about\interests\programming</h2>
        <p>I have been programming for a little under 4 months now. I believe it is the right job path for
          me, seeing as typing is rather fun for me, and seeing things that I make in action gives me
          plenty of pride in what I do. The languages I know at the moment are HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h3>C:\about\interests\fightinggames</h3>
        <p>Fighting video games have always been a big draw for me, they're amazing to both play and watch.
          They mix pure skill with great psychology, a thinking man's genre. Although I'm a novice, (much
          like programming), I'm constantly learning more and more about how to play better.</p>
